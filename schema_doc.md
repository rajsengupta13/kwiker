# Why This Schema Fits Kwikar Business Model

## 1. Built Around Kwikar's Real Revenue Model

Kwikar does not take commission from customer service payments.

Instead:

* Customers pay technicians directly
* Kwikar earns from technician subscriptions
* ABDs and referral technicians earn from subscription distribution

The schema is designed specifically for this flow.

---

## 2. Supports Infinite Referral Network

The `referral_relationships` table allows:

* ABD → Technician
* Technician → Technician
* Multi-level referral chains

This supports:

* 25% direct ABD earnings
* 10% indirect ABD earnings
* 15% technician referral earnings

without changing database structure later.

---

## 3. Pincode-Based Business Structure

Kwikar operates area-wise.

The schema includes:

* `abd_pincodes`
* `technician_pincodes`
* subscription per pincode

This matches the operational model exactly.

## 4. Booking Broadcast System

Customers do not choose technicians manually.

Instead:

* booking is broadcasted
* nearby active technicians receive notification
* featured and priority technicians can get earlier visibility

The `booking_broadcasts` table supports this properly.

---

## 5. Future Monetization Ready

The schema already supports:

* Featured technician boosts
* Priority leads
* Subscription plans
* Wallets
* Withdrawals
* Promotions

So future revenue features can be added without redesign.

---

## 6. Scalable Architecture

Important systems are separated properly:

* users
* bookings
* subscriptions
* referrals
* commissions
* wallets
* notifications

This avoids tight coupling and future scaling issues.

---

## 7. Admin Flexibility

Admin can later change:

* commission percentages
* subscription pricing
* referral levels
* pincode mapping
* monetization strategy

without rebuilding the database.

---

## Conclusion

This schema is designed specifically for Kwikar's:

* area-based service model
* technician referral network
* subscription business
* broadcast booking system
* future monetization plans

while keeping the system scalable and flexible for long-term growth.
